Rules of thumb

- the point is to build a diversified collection of stable, continuously growing 
  companies that throw off a reliable stream of cash (retiree issue)
- if you start with dividend aristocrats or kings, you have a higher expectation of 
-- aristocrat: 25+ years of continuous dividend increases (S&P500 index only)
-- king: 50+ years on continuous dividend increases
  continued dividend _increases_
- a price at or below midpoint of price span during past year is (probably) "fair"
  (admitedly not a lot of thinking in this one!)
- if the dividend + div growth looks like > 8% (reinvested) at 10 yrs: GOOD
- if the dividend + div growth looks like > 10% (reinvested) at 10 yrs: GREAT
- free cash flow should "well cover" dividends (TODO: quantify)
