#/usr/bin/env bash
# given a stream of JSON on stdin and a stock symbol on cmdline
# only pass through JSON records that have payout < 100%
# TODO: we need to consider payout as a number, not a string

# first we remove all the NaN
# then we convert the targetGain STRING to a number
# finally we can filter (sorted order might be nice)
# ./filter-out-NaN | ./convert-targetGain-to-number | jq -c 'select( .targetGain >= 0 )'
jq -c 'select( (.payout|tonumber) <= 100 )'
