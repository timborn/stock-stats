#/usr/bin/env bash
# time to learn a little jq-fu
# given a stream of JSON on stdin and a stock symbol on cmdline
# only pass through JSON records that do have positive targetGain

# jq -c 'select( .symbol != "'$1'" )'

# first we remove all the NaN
# then we convert the targetGain STRING to a number
# finally we can filter (sorted order might be nice)
./filter-out-NaN | ./convert-targetGain-to-number | jq -c 'select( .targetGain >= 0 )'
